@model Razor.Models.Product
@*Razor statements start with the @ character. In this case, the @model statement declares the type of the model object that I
will pass to the view from the action method. This allows me to refer to the methods, fields, and properties of the view model
object through @Model, as shown in Listing 5-4, which shows a simple addition to the Index view.*@


@{
    ViewBag.Title = "Product Name";
}


Product Name: @Model.Name
